REMO - Rule Editor for ModSecurity
----------------------------------

Remo is a project to build a graphical rule editor for ModSecurity,
an Apache security module.

Remo has been started in January 2007, i plan to have an alpha release
in February 2007, going beta sometimes during spring.  Basic Concept

Modsecurity is not a simple toy. It is quite tricky to configure
successfully. Many web applications are not very simple either. Bringing
them together by writing a modsecurity ruleset is very difficult.
Modsecurity.org advertises a tested core ruleset granting you protection
from most known attacks. But this is only a blacklisting approach:
All dangerous is filtered out.

A network firewall uses a whitelisting approach; also called positive
security model: Everything is dropped outside of a short and strict
rulset. An application firewall should do exactly the same. (See Ivan
Ristic's thougts on positive security. Ivan Ristic is the man behind
modsecurity.)

But this comes with a catch: Your application does not come with a short
and strict ruleset and writing one will be tough. This is the point where
remo will come into play. It is meant as a graphical editor for this
ruleset, thus helping you to generate a whitelist of valid requests to
your application. Ideally you will be able to bundle this ruleset with
every release of your online application. We are not there yet. Far from
it to be honest. But the development has started and you are welcome to
join in.  Screenshot detail Features

This is the short list of features done so far:

 * Ruby on rails application with ajax use
 * Enter http requests, display them, edit them, delete 
   them, rearrange them
 * Generate simple positive modsecurity2 ruleset

Near future plans

 * Transform the request list into a treeview of requests
 * Extend the request record to include the full variety of 
   http header fields (so far it is only method and path)
 * Generate a strict ruleset based on such a list of full blown request records
